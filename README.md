# FP16-INT4 / POSIT4 MAC Unit

## Project Overview

This project implements a **FP16-INT4 / POSIT4 MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) Unit** that computes MAC operations using **shift-and-add** in a **bit-serial fashion**. The unit is designed to efficiently perform mixed-precision arithmetic for machine learning and other hardware-accelerated applications.

### Key Features:
- Supports **FP16** and **INT4** (or **POSIT4**) arithmetic.
- Computes **MAC operations** using a shift-and-add technique.
- **Bit-serial** implementation to reduce area and power consumption in hardware.
- Verilog implementation for simulation and hardware integration.

## Tools Required

- **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**: Verilog compiler to compile the testbench and module.
- **GTKWave**: A waveform viewer to visualize the simulation output.

You can install these tools as follows:

### Installing Icarus Verilog (iverilog)
- On Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install iverilog
  ```
- On macOS:
  ```bash
  brew install gtkwave
  ```

## How to Run the Simulation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/FP16-INT4-POSIT4-MAC.git
   cd FP16-INT4-POSIT4-MAC
   ```
2. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   make fp_int_mul
   ```
3. Expected Results should show that the results passed simulation verification.
4. To clean the generated temp files:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```


## To do
- Finish the Accumulation module for Integer
- Implement the MAC operation for Posit4
- Integrate synthesis flow into the Repo
